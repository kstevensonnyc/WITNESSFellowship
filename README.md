The WITNESS Media Lab Fellowship is a 15-week program designed to support the innovative curation of eyewitness video to support human rights documentation and advocacy. I am searching and indexing the distribution of eyewitness footage of violence toward transgender and gender non-conforming people. I plan to audit, index and contextualize online and social media channels that host and promote eyewitness videos of violent acts against these communities as entertainment.
